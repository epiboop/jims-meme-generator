# Jim's Meme Generator
A `canvas`-powered meme generator inspired by Australia's favourite mower.  
To replicate, you'll need to package Futura Bold Oblique to get the text right.  


See it in action [right here](https://rmit-jc.github.io/).

This project was fuelled by Monstercat, Sky Ferreira, and MDN.
