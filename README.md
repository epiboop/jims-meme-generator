# Jim's Meme Generator
A `canvas`-powered meme generator inspired by Australia's favourite mower.  
To replicate, you'll need to package Futura Bold Oblique to get the text right.  


This started as a joke between friends long ago, so, in that spirit it's pretty stripped back. You can make your own version all pretty if you'd like. Things I'd like to add/change:
1. Different coloured versions (true to the many variations of the real Jim's logo.)
2. A reset button  (`canvas` draws over the top of itself when it's called sequentially, resulting in layered text -- yuck.)
3. Dynamically resizing the canvas to accommodate for longer text (yes, you SHOULD be able to insert the entire Bee Movie script into the Jim's logo.)

See it in action [right here](https://rmit-jc.github.io/).

This project was fuelled by Monstercat, Sky Ferreira, and MDN.
